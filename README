================================================
pngquant version 0.75 (BETA) of 26 December 2000
================================================

pngquant is a simple tool with one purpose:  convert 32-bit RGBA PNGs into
8-bit RGBA-palette PNGs (or fewer than 8 bits, if you want), via quantization
and either ordered or diffusion (Floyd-Steinberg) dithering.

The current beta version is basically functional but lacks several important
features:

 - no multifile support (e.g., "pngquant -fs 256 *.png")

 - no ancillary chunk preservation (except gAMA)

 - no preservation of significant-bits info after rescaling (sBIT chunk)

 - no mapfile support

It also doesn't treat 16-bit-per-sample files or gray+alpha files specially
(all samples get truncated to 8 bits and all images are promoted to RGBA
before quantization).  These issues will be addressed in time, but multifile
support is the highest priority at the moment.

Version 0.75 fixes a bug or two, adds tRNS optimization, and changes the
default behavior in a couple of respects, including making Floyd-Steinberg
the default dithering method (since it usually looks much better, at least
for interesting alpha channels).  See the CHANGELOG file for the complete
list.

By the way, be sure to check "before" and "after" file sizes, preferably with
pngcrush (http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/); dithered palette images may
be four times smaller to begin with, but they don't compress nearly as well
as grayscale and truecolor images.  Some images, such as Henri Sivonen's alpha
button (http://www.pp.htv.fi/hsivone1/css-test/bitmapstyle.html), can be made
smaller as full 32-bit RGBA images (4076 bytes in this case) than as either
FS-dithered palette (4550 bytes) or ordered-dither palette (4482 bytes) images.

See http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/apps/pngquant.html for updates.

Copyright and license info:
--------------------------

The quantization and dithering code is lifted from Jef Poskanzer's ppmquant,
part of his wonderful PBMPLUS tool suite.  The PNG reading and writing code
is a merged and slightly simplified version of readpng, readpng2, and writepng
from my book, "PNG: The Definitive Guide."  pngquant therefore inherits both
licenses, one for each source file.  (Note that both licenses are basically
BSD-like; i.e., use the code however you like, as long as you acknowledge its
origins.)
