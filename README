===============================================
pngquant version 0.7 (BETA) of 24 December 2000
===============================================

pngquant is a simple tool with one purpose:  convert 32-bit RGBA PNGs into
8-bit RGBA-palette PNGs (or fewer than 8 bits, if you want), via quantization
and either ordered or diffusion (Floyd-Steinberg) dithering.

The current beta version is basically functional but lacks several important
features:

 - no reordering of the palette so that opaque entries can be eliminated
   from the tRNS chunk

 - no multifile support (e.g., "pngquant -fs 256 *.png")

 - no ancillary chunk preservation (except gAMA)

 - no mapfile support

It also doesn't treat 16-bit-per-sample files or gray+alpha files specially
(all samples get truncated to 8 bits and all images promoted to RGBA before
quantization).  These issues will be addressed in time, but palette optimi-
zation and multifile support are first on the list.

I'm also debating whether to make FS dithering the default; ordered dithering
usually looks terrible, at least with interesting alpha channels (i.e., ones
not used solely for antialiasing curved and diagonal edges).

By the way, be sure to check "before" and "after" file sizes, preferably with
pngcrush (http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/); dithered palette images may
be four times smaller to begin with, but they don't compress nearly as well
as grayscale and truecolor images.  Some images, such as Henri Sivonen's alpha
button (http://www.pp.htv.fi/hsivone1/css-test/bitmapstyle.html), can be made
smaller as full 32-bit RGBA images (4076 bytes in this case) than as either
FS-dithered palette (4622 bytes) or ordered-dither palette (4554 bytes) images.
(Palette-reordering would remove only 107 bytes from each dithered image in
this case.)

Copyright and license info:
--------------------------

The quantization and dithering code is lifted from Jef Poskanzer's ppmquant,
part of his wonderful PBMPLUS tool suite.  The PNG reading and writing code
is a merged and slightly simplified version of readpng, readpng2, and writepng
from my book, "PNG: The Definitive Guide."  pngquant therefore inherits both
licenses, one for each source file.  (Note that both licenses are basically
BSD-like; i.e., use the code however you like, as long as you acknowledge its
origins.)
